        <div>Dhoni began his career in 1998 by playing for Bihar U-19 team. He also played for East Zone U-19 team. In 1999-2000, he made a debut for Bihar in Ranji Trophy. His brilliant performances in the Deodhar Trophy, Duleep Trophy and India 'A' tour of Kenya, brought him to the notice of the national team selectors. He was then selected to play for the Indian Cricket team in 2004, where he made his ODI debut against Bangladesh in Chittagong.</div>
        <div>Since then, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has come a long way in cricket. His sterling performances with the bat have rescued India from many a tight positions. In his illustrious career, Dhoni has played 90 Tests scoring 4876 runs with his highest being 224 against Australia at Chennai in 2013. His amazing statistics behind the stumps include 256 catches and 38 stumpings.</div>
        <div>In the ODI scenario, Dhoni has so far played 265 matches scoring 8620 runs, with his highest being a staggering 183 not-out against Sri Lanka, in Jaipur, 2005-06. His ODI wicket-keeping statistics include 246 catches and 85 stumpings. Dhoni made his ICC Cricket World Cup debut in 2007 and played only three matches due to India's early exit. India won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, among others, under his captainship.</div>

        <ul>
            <li>The Childhood Years </li>
            <li>Mahendra Singh Dhoni had always been a bit of a sportsman right from the time when he used to be in the 5th standard at DAV Shyamali in Ranchi and truth be told, he has acknowledged that his parents always encouraged him to participate in sporting endeavors, without putting undue pressure on him regarding the rat race of education. That is something you can notice in the way Dhoni conducts himself on the cricket field. He is a fierce competitor no doubt but he treats the game as a game without letting it affect him personally and that is the reason why you would never see him shouting animatedly at his bowlers or fielders when things go awry. His father Pan Singh was employed at the junior levels at MECON and hence there wasn’t an abundance of money in the family but they were not desperately poor either.</li>
            <li>Turning Point</li>
            <li>Dhoni was never interested in cricket when he was a child but he was someone who excelled in badminton and football, in which he played as a goalkeeper. Cricket was a game that he used to play once in a while in his locality but badminton and football were the games in which he represented his school as well as his district. However, it all changed one fine day when he was asked to play for a local club as a wicket keeper since their regular ‘keeper was indisposed. Now, since Dhoni was a goalkeeper in football, he had the basic agility that was required to become a good ‘keeper and so it was in this game he first announced himself as a wicket keeper of rare ability.
			</li>
			<li>From then on, he went from strength to strength as a cricketer but there was no apparent breakthrough other than the fact that he was getting selected regularly in grade cricket. However, Dhoni realized that he needed a job in order to sustain his family and so it was in the year 2000 that he was took up the job of a train ticket examiner or TTE in the Indian Railways. For those who might have traveled in Eastern railway might have encountered Dhoni as a TTE during those years between 2000 and 2003. This was however the best decision that he could have taken since as an employee of the Indian Railways he was able to play cricket for a strong domestic cricket side and truth be told, it was his stint with the Railways that really thrust him into the limelight.</li>
			<li>It was in 2004 that he was eventually selected for India and the rest as we all know would surely be a part of modern Indian history.</li>
